This is a sample message that will be ciphered.
“Do you wanna build a snowman?”
It doesn't look very interesting now but,
It will look very cryptic afterwards.
I am demonstrating, that “I” can use special characters.
And they will be redisplayed in the output, like quotations,
	or even tabs.
Python is cool.
