PythonProgramming
=================

This repository contains several projects that I wrote for my Python programming course. 

A link on the repository description above will lead you to several blogged posts tagged with
the pythonprogramming category that describes the a few projects along 
with other analysis(that aren't source code) in regards to the projects.

The projects are all written for Python3. 
All projects were completed during the Spring 2014 school semester. 
Each project has its own directory and comes with a readme that explains the product of the project and how to run it.

This respository only contains the source code.
